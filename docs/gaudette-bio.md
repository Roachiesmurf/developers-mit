## Bio
 - Name: George
 - Hometown: I hail from the banks of the river of many fish
 - Favorite food: free, catered lunches
 - Hobby: gardening
 - Red is my favorite color.  According to some resources available on the Web, this means I specifically enjoy physical labor and working with my hands.  Perhaps this accounts for my hobby.
