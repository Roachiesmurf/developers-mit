## Bio
 - My name is George
 - I hail from the banks of the river of many fish
 - My favorite food is free, catered lunches
 - Red is my favorite color.  According to some resources available on the Web, this means I specifically enjoy physical labor and working with my hands.  It turns out that's more or less true.
